## About me and my 'code'

ðŸ‘‹ My name is Michiel, which has a *very* Dutch pronunciation, so feel free to call me Michael. 

ðŸš€ During the daytime I am a Solutions Engineer at Cloudflare, but when I get the chance I like to slap together Go/Python/Shell code for automating my home and other types of fun. However, I mainly use GitHub for (professional) contributions or forking other people's code.

ðŸ‘‰ You can find my own repos on [codeberg.org/michielappelman](https://codeberg.org/michielappelman).

ðŸ“ž For other ways of contacting me, please visit my personal page at [appelman.se](https://appelman.se/).
